## Introduction
With Akvo Caddisfly you can test water quality parameters as part of your data collection. Simply said, Akvo Caddisfly is a question type in Akvo Flow. 

By adding Akvo Caddisfly to Akvo Flow water quality data becomes real-time accessible and shareable via the Akvo Flow online workspace. Water quality measurements can be combined with GPS-data, metadata and qualitative data, allowing for easier interpretation of testing results, seeing the water quality data in context of other data. This enables faster, better interventions to take place. 




Why Akvo Caddisfly?



www.un.org/sustainabledevelopm...
Around the globe, many organisations, companies and governments are working towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 6 focuses on ensuring access to safe water and sanitation for all. On both programme and national level, data needs to be collected in order to monitor progress. Without the right tools, efficient monitoring can be a challenge.

Akvo Caddisfly contributes to solving that challenge. Caddisfly can measure the relevant water quality parameters for SDG 6 and more, in the field. With our app on your phone, you can conduct surveys to collect both water quality data and other related data that is important for your analysis. All surveys are sent to one online data platform (Akvo Flow), allowing for rapid data analysis, visualisation (Akvo Lumen) and decision-making, up to regional or national level.

Current water quality testing systems can be hard to use in the field, and lab-based tests are expensive and cause delays. Resulting data is generally difficult to share, making it hard to engage communities and quickly act upon problems in local water supplies. We believe that with available water quality parameters, combined with the use of phones and our data platform solution, Caddisfly is well placed to play a vital role in the global efforts to monitor the achievement of the SDGs. 

## Which test type in Akvo Flow matches with which piece of equipment?
When defining your Flow form you need to make sure you select the right test for your Akvo Caddisfly question. Once you are collecting data, the Flow app will open the exact test in the Caddisfly app automatically. So making sure you well define your question is important. 

To choose the right test for the question you go through four drop down menus, helping you ensure the right test is linked to the question:

Sample - Are you going to test water or soil 
Parameter - which parameter are you going to measure with this question 
Brand - test methods we support to test the selected parameter
Details - test ranges, reagent codes and other information to help you ensure you have selected the right test.

## Installing Akvo Caddisfly app

## Download the Akvo Caddisfly App
The Akvo Caddisfly app is downloaded through the Google Playstore on your phone. The app requires Android 4.4 (2013) or higher. 


## The difference between the Akvo Flow and Caddisfly app
The Akvo Caddisfly is an add-on to Akvo Flow in order to include water quality data in a Akvo Flow Survey. The Akvo Caddisfly app has the following functions:

Connect water quality equipment to your smartphone 
Instruct you on how to perform a water quality test
Analyse the test result
Send the test result to Akvo Flow

## Recommended devices
To be able to make the most out of your Akvo Caddisfly and Akvo Flow app, we have put together a list of minimum device requirements to help you choose the best device for your data collection project. 

With Akvo Caddisfly you can test water quality using different types of tests. Some connect to the app via bluetooth, some need your device to have a good camera to recognise the colour reference card and strip. 

The requirements for strip testing in combination with the colour reference card are stricter. We have drawn up a list of devices that we have successfully tested with strip tests using the Caddisfly app: 

Samsung Galaxy J5 models and newer versions 
Samsung On5 Pro 
Samsung Galaxy SII Neo 
Asus ZOOLD 
OnePlus 3 
Motorola Moto G 2nd generation 

## Downloading the Caddisfly app offline
What to do when you need to download the Caddisfly app to large group of users and the internet connection is shabby and downloading from Play Store is not working well enough? 

You can now use a Google approved file sharing app like 'Files by Google'. This app allows you to share Play store installed apps offline and auto updates of the app will work. 

Install the Files by Google app beforehand.
