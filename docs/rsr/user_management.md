## Using the Project Access Restrictions (PAR) feature
The Project Access Restrictions (PAR) feature allows an organisation's administrator to restrict and/or grant users access to projects in the organisation's project portfolio. 

The feature is accessible via User Management page, which is found by navigating to the upper left corner of the page. Click 'User Management'. 




Once on the User Managment page search for the appropriate user: 




When the user has been found click *'Restrict access'*. 





From this page you can see you which projects the selected user has access to (in black) and which projects have access restricted (in red). 




If you want to grant the user access to all projects, simply uncheck the top box: 




To grant or restrict access to a project for a user that has had the PAR already enabled, find the user by searching in User Management and click *'Edit access'*: 




Once on the PAR page, check the box next to the project you wish to grant or restrict access to: 





## Fine Access Control (FAC)
The Fine Access Control (FAC) feature has been designed to allow RSR administrators to limit access to a project to only the implementing project team. By activating this feature an administrator helps ensure only those users who should have access to a project do. This can be helpful for large organisations who have many RSR users and many projects as not all users work on all projects for an organisation, i.e. users have particular project portfolio. 

Similarly, programmes with many partners (e.g. large programmes) can mean that there are many RSR users, from different organisations, that can have access to a project(s) in which they are actually not directly involved. By using FAC an administrator of a large, multi-project, multi-partner programme can ensure that only those users that should have to a project, do.



**Step 1:** User Access for a project is done via section 3 of the Editor




**Step 2:** From section 3, scroll down to go to User Access section and click *‘Restricted Access’*




**Step 3:** Once you activated the feature, add users that should have access to the project by clicking *‘Add user’*


**Step 4:** You can search for registered users for your organisation and also users for the project’s partners.


**Step 5:** Users added to a project retain the role assigned to them by their RSR administrator when they’ve first registered with RSR. However, a user's role can be changed for particular projects. For example, a user can have a *‘default’* role of M&E Manager, but a for a particular project they could be assigned the role of *‘Enumerator’*.



**Step 6:** Review and confirm the users granted access for your project directly from section 3


**Step 7:** You can also see which users have access to a project directly from the ‘My Projects’ page. 

## Password policy
In RSR it is now possible to set a password policy for your organization. A password policy is a set of rules that dictate the requirements for creating and using passwords by users. The purpose of a password policy is to enhance the security of user accounts and sensitive data by encouraging users to create strong and unique passwords. The password password policy on RSR allows us to define:

- **Password Length:** The minimum and maximum number of characters a password must have to be considered valid.

- **Complexity Requirements:** Guidelines about including a mix of different character types, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.

- **Password Expiration:** The time interval after which a user is required to change their password. This prevents the prolonged use of the same password.

- **Password History:** Ensures that users cannot reuse a certain number of previous passwords, preventing them from cycling through a limited set of passwords.

If you wish to use this feature, please get in touch and we shall enable it for your organization.

### Password expiration
Password expiry is a security measure designed to enhance the protection of your account. Regularly updating your password helps safeguard your information and sensitive data from potential breaches. When enabled, users will be required to change their passwords after a period specified on the password policy, ensuring that unauthorized access is minimized. 

On RSR you can set passwords to expire after a certain number of days between 1 and 999 or you can specify that passwords never expire by setting the number of days to 0. Once the time elapses and a user attempts to login they will be redirected to the password setting page.

![Managing users](media/password_expired.png)

To set a new password the user is expected to provide:

- their old password

- a new password

- confirm the new password: enter the new password twice to avoid typographical errors.

Upon successful submission of the new password and update the user's password, the user is redirected to the **'My RSR'** page

**Please note** that the password should meet the criteria as defined in your organizations policy
