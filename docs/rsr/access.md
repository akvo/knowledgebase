## Enabling two-factor authentication

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is an identity and access management security method that helps safeguard information by requiring two forms of identification to access resources and data. Enabling two-factor authentication means that RSR will ask for an additional code, in addition to email and password, when authenticating. This code will be generated by an authenticator app (e.g. Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator) that you can install on your phone.

To enable 2 FA on RSR got to Go to [My details page](https://rsr.akvo.org/my-rsr/my-details/) and find the section **Two-factor authentication**
