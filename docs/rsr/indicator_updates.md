## Unlocking reporting periods

## Bulk locking and unlocking your indicators (M&E manager)
In addition to unlocking and locking indicators individually, i.e. one by one, you can also unlock and lock your indicators in bulk. Using the ‘Filter Periods’ dropdown select the appropriate reporting period. 


Once displayed, all indicators for that reporting period will be ‘checked’ by default, from here you click either ‘Unlock selected’ or ‘Lock selected. This is very helpful for those projects working with results frameworks that contain many indicators. 


## Entering indicator results data

## Assigning indicators to Project Officers

## Review indicator updates submitted by Project Officers
Pending approval

To ensure data quality, organizations that want to use indicator reporting updates for results reporting need to have an appointed an M&E manager in RSR. As an M&E manager, you are required to approve the indicator reporting updates that are submitted by the officers for your project(s). While Project Officers (who have been assigned the role of ‘Project Editor’ in RSR) will focus their attention for indicator reporting on the ‘Pending Approval’ tab, M&E Managers begin their review of indicator reporting updates, submitted by their team, in the ‘Pending Approval’ tab.

The ‘Pending Approval’ tab is where M&E managers can see which indicators have been reported on, and review the results data submitted with each update. If the M&E manager has no questions on the results data submitted, she/he simply clicks ‘Approve’ to send the update to the ‘Approved’ tab. However, when you would like the Project Officer to have a second look at the results they reported, you click "Return for revision". This sends the update back to the Project Officer, and it will once again (re)appear in the ‘Needs Reporting’ tab for them.





Approved

Once an indicator reporting update has been approved, the update is moved to the ‘Approved’ tab. From here M&E managers will lock the reporting period for each indicator after all updates for each indicator has been approved. When an indicator reporting period has been locked, additional indicator updates for that period are not possible; the indicator update will no longer appear in the ‘Approved’ tab. Results data for indicator updates that have been approved and locked will be included in the aggregated overall results for that particular indicator and the results data of the update become publicly visible. 




Overview/Full view

For a quick snapshot of all of your indicators, including your progress to date (Actual vs. Target or Baseline vs. Target) you can use the ‘Overview’ feature. From here you can see your target (result) vs. actual (result) per each indicator reporting period.





For a more high-level view, you can use the overall progress via the ‘progress doughnut’, which tells your percentage of completion related to the overall target set for the indicator.
