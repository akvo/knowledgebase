Once you've clicked Add user, a pop-up menu will appear. At the top, you can enter the mail address of the enumerator you would like to add. 

The system will recognise if it is a new user. After you entered a name for the new enumerator, click on the arrow next to Add as, from there select Enumerator. Once done click Send Invite.

After the invite is sent you can choose to either invite another enumerator by clicking on Invite Another, or click Close. 

Now the required enumerator is added as a user, you should inform the enumerator that an invite to RSR should will be received via email. Ask the enumerator to open the invite and follow the instructions to ensure the enumerator gets registered.

## (Un)assigning indicators to an enumerator
**Important:** To be able to assign indicators to an enumerator, please first ensure the required enumerator is already a registered user in RSR.

To start assigning indicators, go to the Enumerators tab of the project. On the right hand side of the page you will see the Enumerators List, i.e., all users that have been registered as Enumerator for your project.

To assign indicators, there are two options:

- You manually click on the checkbox next to the preferred indicator(s), or; 
- You click on the square, next to the search bar, and select ‘All indicators’ or ‘All unassigned indicators’ to select multiple at once.
Once you have selected the required indicators, you can assign an enumerator on the right where Indicator Assignment has appeared. Select the enumerator(s) and then click Assign. You can add multiple enumerators at once.

Now that the enumerator has been assigned indicators, you can go back by clicking on Full List (next to Indicator Assignment) to access the full Enumerators List again.

In the Enumerators List, if you click below the name of the Enumerator on the arrow (next to the number of indicators) a list will appear. From here you can see which indicators have been assigned to that enumerator and you can also Unassign an indicator if needed.
