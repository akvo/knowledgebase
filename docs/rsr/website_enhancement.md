# Website enhancement using Akvo Pages
Many organisations using Akvo RSR for visualising their projects also choose to have their data displayed in a more personalised format. By utilising Akvo Pages, organisations can create their own set of pages that contain lists of only projects they are working on along with the partners that are involved in these projects.

Akvo Pages can be customised by utilising the CSS Template upload function that allows colours, styles and logos to be inserted from the organisation's own themes.

It is possible to insert the Akvo Pages as a subsection into an organisation's website. Using a web redirect, the page can be placed within the same domain, meaning that users visiting the site will not necessarily be aware that these are not internal pages to the organisation's site, but can continue to browse through projects and organisations and then navigate back to the original website with ease.
