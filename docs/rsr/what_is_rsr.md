# Overview
Akvo Really Simple Reporting is a web and Android-based system that makes it easy for development aid teams to bring complex networks of projects online and instantly share progress with everyone involved and interested. Explore the full portfolio of RSR projects online at rsr.akvo.org.

In order to use RSR, you must choose a way to both enter and manage your information within RSR.

We have developed several ways for you to interact with your information, allowing you to select the process that most closely suits your organisationâ€™s needs.

- Direct entry using My Projects
- Automated Entry using Write API

All projects in RSR need to be communicated within the pre-defined project text fields that are created in MyRSR to provide a clear and transparent view of aid projects. To find out more about what data must be supplied, please check out our Akvo RSR Data Requirements page.

# Communicating
Once your information is stored within the RSR Database, it is ready to be shared with the public. All published information will be displayed at rsr.akvo.org, but we also offer several different visualisation options that allow a more customised and controlled experience for your users.

- Website Enhancement using Akvo Pages
- Complete Custom Website using Akvo Sites
- Distributed Promotion using Akvo Widgets
- Automated System Integration using Akvo Read API

# Reporting
Of course the world does not stop once you have all of your information in RSR. So we have developed tools to assist in reporting on your project's progress.

Add narratives with photo and video to communicate the progress of your project via RSR Updates.
Share the progress of reaching your project targets and goals via a RSR results frameworkRSR results framework.
Export reports containing project information.

# IATI
IATI is the International Aid Transparency Initiative. The IATI XML standard lets computers understand and exchange information about development aid organisations and activities. This increases the availability and usefulness of that information exponentially. It means that your work is published in ways that allow it to be studied, transferred, assimilated, used and built-on in new forms of reports or visualisations.

When you enter project information into Akvo RSR, it gives you the opportunity to let your report fit the IATI standard. It goes further by letting you attach much richer forms of data to project and programme work such as short videos, photo streams and status updates. You can also use RSR to prompt people to provide relevant kinds of updates at any given time. So you can fulfil your own reporting and communication needs and publish your work via IATI all in one go.
